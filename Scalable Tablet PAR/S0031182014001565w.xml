            <title>SUMMARY</title>
            <p>
               <italic>Nosema bombycis</italic>, a pathogen of silkworm pebrine, is an obligate unicellular eukaryotic parasite. It is reported that the spore wall proteins have essential functions in the adherence and infection process of microsporidia. To date, the information related to spore wall proteins from microsporidia is still limited. Here, a 44 kDa spore wall protein NbSWP16 was characterized in <italic>N. bombycis.</italic> In NbSWP16, a 25 amino acids signal peptide and 3 heparin binding motifs were predicted. Interestingly, a region that contains 3 proline-rich tandem repeats lacking homology to any known protein was also present in this protein. The immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) demonstrated that distinct fluorescent signals were detected both on the surface of mature spores and the germinated spore coats. Immunolocation by electron microscopy revealed that NbSWP16 localized on the exospore regions. Finally, spore adherence analysis indicated that spore adherence to host cell was decreased more than 20% by anti-NbSWP16 blocking compared with the negative control <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast with anti-NbSWP16, no remarkable decrement inhibition was detected when antibodies of NbSWP16 and NbSWP5 were used simultaneously. Collectively, these results suggest that NbSWP16 is a new exospore protein and probably be involved in spore adherence of <italic>N. bombycis</italic>.</p>

         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Microsporidia are obligate intracellular unicellular organisms, which are kinds of spore-forming fungal pathogens. Microsporidia can infect a wide variety of animals ranging from vertebrate to invertebrate species, including human beings (Didier <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">1998</xref>). To date, more than 1300 species are identified. Of these, at least 13 species have been described as pathogens in humans, especially the AIDS patients (Didier <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">1998</xref>; Corradi <italic>et al.</italic> 
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">2008</xref>). Also, more than 150 species are reported using insect as host (Becnel and Andreadis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1999</xref>), such as <italic>Nosema bombycis</italic>, which is the first identified microsporidia infecting <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (Nageli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">1857</xref>; Becnel and Andreadis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1999</xref>). In 2013, the genome of <italic>N. bombycis</italic> was released (Pan <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14a">2013</xref>). There is no doubt that it will facilitate strongly to unveil the mystery underlying this parasite, such as the process of infection and invasion.</p>
         <p>Now, it is reported that the spore wall proteins play key roles in the host–pathogens interaction process, including the pathogen infection, invasion and other pathogenic process (Weidner <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">1992</xref>; Weidner and Halonen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">1993</xref>). Some researchers discovered that spore wall proteins adhere to host cell using a mechanism involving host cell surface glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) (Hayman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2005</xref>; Southern <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2007</xref>). In <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, 2 exospores SWP1, SWP2, 1 endospore SWP3, and a protein named EcEnP1 had been identified. It was indicated that EcEnP1 could function as a potential spore adherence ligand and be involved in host cell adherence and infection (Bohne <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2000</xref>; Peuvel-Fanget <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2006</xref>; Xu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">2006</xref>; Southern <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2007</xref>). In 2001, 2 exospore proteins, SWP1 and SWP2, were described in <italic>Encephalitozoon intestinalis</italic> (Hayman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2001</xref>). Recently, 14 hypothetical spore wall proteins were identified using proteomic-based approach in <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Wu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2008</xref>). To date, SWP1, SWP2 and SWP26 were expressed mainly on the endospore, other 2 proteins SWP3 and SWP5 were expressed on exospores in <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Wu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2008</xref>; Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13a">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13b">2012</xref>). In function analysis, SWP26 was proved to be associated with the host cell adherence via the heparin binding motif (HBMs) (Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13a">2009</xref>). SWP5 can interact with the polar tube proteins PTP2 and PTP3 and mediate the infection of <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13b">2012</xref>) or host cell invasion (Cai <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2a">2011</xref>). In addition, SWP26, SWP1, SWP3 and SWP12 were proved to be able of binding to deproteinated chitin spore coat of <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Yang <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>; Chen <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2b">2013</xref>). However, among these reported proteins, only 2 spore wall proteins having tandem repeats were reported, including SWP1 of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and SWP2 of <italic>E. intestinalis</italic>. In these 2 proteins, SWP1 of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> has 5 glycine- and serine-rich repeats at C-terminal and SWP2 of <italic>E. intestinalis</italic> has 50 repeats with 12-or 15-amino acids length at C-terminal , both of them having no proline in the tandem repeats (Bohne <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2000</xref>; Hayman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2001</xref>). In this paper, a new spore wall protein NbSWP16 with 3 proline-rich tandem repeats was identified in <italic>N. bombycis</italic>.</p>

            <p>To date, 15 spore wall proteins have been described in <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Appendix, Table A1). Here, by scanning the genome of <italic>N. bombycis</italic>, a protein (GenBank NO: EOB14338) annotated as spore wall protein and anchoring dick complex was found, we named it as NbHSWP16. The signal peptide of protein sequence was predicted using online tools (<uri xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP</uri>) (Julenius <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">2005</xref>). Protein motif prediction was carried out using SMART proteomic tools (<uri xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de" xlink:type="simple">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de</uri>). The glycosylation sites (<uri xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc</uri>) and phosphorylation sites (<uri xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos</uri>) were predicted. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor motif was predicted using the online program big-PI predictor (<uri xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/gpi/gpi_server.html" xlink:type="simple">http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/gpi/gpi_server.html</uri>). Subcellular localization predication was performed using the PSORT server (<uri xlink:href="http://psort.hgc.jp/" xlink:type="simple">http://psort.hgc.jp/</uri>). To find the homology proteins of NbHSWP16, BLASTP analysis was performed on the local database. Amino acid sequence alignments were generated using the ClustalX program. Multiple sequence alignment of NbHSWP16 and its homologous proteins were analysed phylogenetically using MEGA5 software to prepare a phylogenetic tree. The tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method.</p>

            <title>Analysis of gene transcription pattern</title>
            <p>RT-PCR was performed to analyse the transcription of gene <italic>Nbhswp16</italic>. The midguts of infected silkworms were collected at 1–8 days and stored at −80°C. The methods used to extract the total RNA were as described previously (Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13b">2012</xref>). The primers used to amplify the <italic>Nbhswp16</italic> gene are as followed: forward primer: 5′-TTTAGCACCAATCCTCAACC-3′ and reverse primer: 5-TTGCCATAATAATGAAGGAG-3′. The <italic>tubulin-β</italic> gene used as an internal control was amplified using the primers: forward primer: 5′-TGGACGCCATTAGACAAG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GGCTCGAGTTCATAACATCTAACC-3′. PCR conditions of <italic>tubulin-β</italic> and <italic>Nbhswp16</italic> were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min.</p>

            <title>Expression, purification and polyclonal antibody production</title>
            <p>The NbHSWP16 protein was expressed as a truncated form without the signal peptide in the N-terminal. Based on the genomic DNA sequence, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed as follows: forward primer: 5′-cgcggatccTCTGTGGAAATAAGAAAAGGC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-gcgtcgacGTCAAAGGAAACACCATAAA-3′. The forward primer and the reverse primer contained a <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>SalI</italic> restriction site, respectively. When the PCR finished, a genomic DNA fragment that coded the amino acid region of 26–383 of NbHSWP16 protein was obtained. Then, the amplified fragment was cloned into the pMD19T vector (Invitrogen). After the DNA fragment was verified by sequence, it was cloned into prokaryotic expression vectors pET30a. The resulting recombinant plasmids were introduced into the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 strain. The recombinant NbHSWP16 (rNbHSWP16) was induced at 37°C for 6 h in the presence of 0·4 m<sc>m</sc> IPTG. The expressed fusion protein was purified with a Ni-NTA Superflow Cartridge (Qiagen). Four mice were immunized with rNbHSWP16 mixed with Freund's adjuvant (1:1; sigma) and one more mice was injected PBS using as negative control. One week after the 4th injection, the mice were sacrificed and their sera were collected and stored at −20°C.</p>

After centrifugation at 12 000 r m<sup>−1</sup> for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was treated with 2·5% SDS, 0·1 <sc>m</sc> DTT and 2-Mercaptoethanol for 4 h at 4°C, then centrifuged and captured supernatant as spore protein sample. For immunoblotting analysis, about 10 <italic>μ</italic>g protein sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). After blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk overnight at 4°C, the membrane was incubated with anti-NbHSWP16 or negative sera (1:1000) for 1 h at 37°C, then membranes were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Following several washes, the membranes were developed with ECL Western blot detection kit (Thermo).</p>

            <p>To analyse the role of NbSWP16 in spore adherence, antibody blocking was performed. Briefly, BmE-SWU1 cells that were used as host cells were seeded on a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 16 h at 28°C. After the culture was removed, spores incubated with anti-NbSWP16 sera (dilution 1:50) as well as the negative sera were added onto the monolayer and incubated for 2 h at 28°C. After removing the unbounded spores and several washing, the average numbers of bounded spores per host cell were counted in at least 20 fields for each sample. Meanwhile, the anti-NbSWP5 was added together with anti-NbSWP16 to determine whether the antibodies have synergistic effect. The significance of the difference between the control and experimental assays was measured using <italic>t</italic>-test. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times.</p>

            <title>Characterization of the gene coding for the hypothetical spore wall protein NbHSWP16</title>
            <p>The gene <italic>Nbhswp16</italic> is 1152 bp and encodes a 383 amino acid protein which has a calculated molecular mass of 44 kDa and a theoretical pI of 9·17. One copy gene (GenBank accession number: EOB12060) having 99% identity with <italic>Nbhswp16</italic> was also found in the genome of <italic>N. bombycis</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>, a 25-amino acid signal peptide was predicted at the N-terminal NbHSWP16, but no GPI anchor sequence signals or transmembrane domain was predicted. According to NetNglyc and NetOglyc analysis, NbHSWP16 contained 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. More than 30 phosphorylation sites, most of which occurred on the residue serine, were predicted. It is worth to notice that there are 3 predicted HBMs at the C-terminal NbHSWP16. More interestingly, a region consisting of 3 proline-rich tandem repeats with no homology to any known protein was also predicted in NbHSWP16. In DNA sequence, not only it was noticed that these tandem sequences are conserved, but also single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were found in partial synonymous codes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). By BLASTP analysis, several homologous proteins of NbHSWP16 were found in several microsporidia, including <italic>Nosema apis, Nosema antheraeae, Nosema ceranae, E. cuniculi, E. intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, Encephalitozoon romaleae</italic> and <italic>Antonospora locustae</italic>, but no homologous was found in <italic>Encephalitozoon bieneusi</italic>. These proteins share 26–34% identity with NbHSWP16. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that NbHSWP16 were conserved comparatively in the evolution process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>).

            <p>In order to survey NbHSWP16 subcellular localization, IFA was performed. From the result of IFA, we noticed that fluorescence signals were detected on the surface of the mature spores as well as on the germinated spore coats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). To further determine the cellular location of NbHSWP16, IEM was employed. The results of IEM demonstrated that labelled gold particles were mainly distributed on the exospore regions of the mature spores. These results suggested that the NbHSWP16 is localized mainly on the exospore wall of the mature spore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). So, we renamed NbHSWP16 as NbSWP16.

            <p>Based on the sequence analysis and subcellular localization of NbSWP16 above, we discovered that NbSWP16 had 3 protein–heparin protein interaction motifs (HBMs), but also can be localized on the exospore of mature spore. To dissect whether NbSWP16 protein is involved in spore adherence or not, spore adherence analysis was performed. The statistical result (Appendix, Table A2) showed that the rate of spore adherence to host cell was decreased more than 20% by anti-NbSWP16 blocking compared with the negative control <italic>in vitro</italic>. But in contrast with anti-NbSWP16 used alone, no remarkable decrement inhibition was detected when antibodies of NbSWP16 and NbSWP5 were used simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>).

         <title>DISCUSSION</title>
         <p>As an obligate unicellular eukaryotic parasite, one of the prominent features of microsporidia is that it could deposit a rigid spore wall on the surface. The spore wall is capable of protecting microsporidia against the environment stress (Shadduck and Polley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">1978</xref>). Now it is documented that the spore wall proteins of microsporidia may function in spore adherence and infection process (Weidner <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">1992</xref>; Weidner and Halonen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">1993</xref>). However, although 10 years has passed since the publication of the first microsporidian genome of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> (Katinka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2001</xref>), the available information about the spore wall protein of microsporidia is still limited, especially the ones having tandem repeat.</p>
         <p>At the present study, a new spore wall protein NbSWP16 was identified in <italic>N. bombycis</italic>. A 25-amino acid signal peptide was predicted at the N-terminal NbSWP16, but no transmembrane domain was predicted. It is proposed that this protein may be secreted. In the western-blotting analysis, NbSWP16 could only be detected in the protein sample obtained in the presence of high concentration of thiolreducing agents dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol, but not be detected in the protein sample prepared with PBS or SDS. This result indicated that disulfide bridges may exist in NbSWP16 and may be required to retain the stability of the spore wall.</p>
         <p>To date, 13 proteins have been described having HBMs in microsporidia, including EcEnP1 in <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> (Southern <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2007</xref>), EiEnP1 in <italic>E. intestinalis</italic> (Southern <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2007</xref>), SWP2, SWP26, SWP3 and 8 other hypothetical spore wall proteins in <italic>N. bombycis</italic> (Wu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2008</xref>; Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13a">2009</xref>). Among these proteins, EcEnP1 and SWP26 were proved to be involved in spore adherence process (Southern <italic>et al.</italic> 
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2007</xref>; Li <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13a">2009</xref>). In this paper, 3 HBMs were predicted in NbSWP16, it suggested the HBMs motifs may contribute to the spore adherence of NbSWP16. From the result of spore adherence analysis, we discovered that anti-NbSWP16 could decrease the spore adherence rate more than 20%. In addition, in contrast with anti-NbSWP16 used alone, no remarkable decrement inhibition was detected when antibodies of NbSWP16 and NbSWP5 were used simultaneously, indicating the anti-NbSWP16 combining anti-NbSWP5 may not have synergistic effect in inhibition. It is still a long way to clarify the molecular mechanism of spore adherence. Unfortunately, it is not success to obtain the soluble protein of NbSWP16. To confirm whether the HBMs is responsible for the spore adherence function of NbSWP16, further work is need.</p>
         <p>A previous data survey using tandem repeats in protein sequence (TRIPS) revealed that proteins with tandem repeats are conspicuous in structural and cell surface proteins (Katti <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">2000</xref>). Moreover, tandem repeats functioning in some species were described previously. In <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, an ActA protein containing 4 repeats, which are 11 amino acids in length and consist of 3 or 4 consecutive prolines, can contribute to the movement rate of this species (Smith <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">1996</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae FlO1</italic> gene consisting of tandem repeated units encodes a cell-surface adhesin that mediates cell–cell and cell-surface adhesion and phenotypic tests illustrated that the intensity of the adhesion directly correlated with the length of the repeat (Verstrepen <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">2005</xref>). Here, 3 proline-rich tandem repeats were found in NbSWP16 and the results of IFA and IEM proved that NbSWP16 is an exospore wall protein. It suggests that the tandem repeats existing in NbSWP16 might be responsible for the function to this protein. Besides, in DNA sequence, though the tandem repeats are conserved in gene <italic>nbswp16</italic>, 6 SNP sites were noticed in some synonymous codes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). This may be associated with the evolution and adaptation of <italic>N. bombycis</italic>. Because some evidence previously mentioned that the variations in tandem repeats can influence organism's phenotypes and facilitate evolution and rapid adaptation (Gemayel <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2012</xref>).</p>
         <p>In conclusion, a novel exospore protein NbSWP16 with 3 proline-rich tandem repeats was characterized in <italic>N. bombycis</italic>. Spore adherence analysis demonstrated NbSWP16 might contribute to the spore adherence <italic>in vitro</italic>. The works focusing on the function of NbSWP16 will be carried out in the future.</p>

            <p>To analyse the role of NbSWP16 in spore adherence, antibody blocking analysis was performed. In each group data (C1/S1, C2/S2 and C3/S3), the spores bounded to 5 selected randomly host cells were counted in 21 independent field and it was repeated 3 times. S1, S2 and S3 represent the 3 times of anti-NbSWP16 blocking analysis, respectively. C1, C2 and C3 represent the control. The raw data of spore counting for each experimental analysis was shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
